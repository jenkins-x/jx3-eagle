    - body: "when we run `jx dash` it opens the dashboard URL using http://username:password@whatever.nip.ip - which is a great way to setup the basic auth for users without them having to lookup secrets and copy/paste things.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the loading of archive logs never triggers in this case - this is never invoked so logs are never queried: https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx-pipelines-visualizer/blob/master/web/static/archived_logs/index.js#L1\r\n\r\nI guess its related to basic auth + `XMLHttpRequest`?\r\n\r\nWhats odd is if you open a browser window via http://whatever.nip.ip  (without the user/pwd) it all works great.\r\n\r\nSo not totally sure what to do about this; its definitely related to the use of XMlHttpRequest making a second query for the logs in archive mode.\r\n\r\nOne idea is to get `jx dash` to open 2 URLs; the first one with the user/pwd and the second without it (the real one to use ;) - not sure really - there must be a better way?\r\n\r\nI guess the real fix is to really use OAuth?"
