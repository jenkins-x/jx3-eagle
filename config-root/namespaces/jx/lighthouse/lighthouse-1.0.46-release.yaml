        fix: handling draft PRs without errors

        ensure we won't log the following error when handling draft PRs switching to the "ready for review" state:

            Could not coerce pull_request event to a GenericCommentEvent. Unknown 'action': "ready_for_review".

        by adding the missing actions to the list of actions that are not related to a PR comment
